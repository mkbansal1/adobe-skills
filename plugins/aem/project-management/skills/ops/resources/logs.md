## Operations

### View Logs (Default: 7 days)

```bash
curl -s \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/log/${ORG}/${SITE}/${REF}"
```

**Success:** `Showing {count} log entries from last 7 days`

   ```
2. Check the status of a path that appears in the logs
   ```
   check status of {path}
   ```

### View Logs with Duration Filter

```bash
# Last hour
curl -s \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/log/${ORG}/${SITE}/${REF}?since=1h"

# Last 24 hours
curl -s \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/log/${ORG}/${SITE}/${REF}?since=24h"

# Last 3 days
curl -s \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/log/${ORG}/${SITE}/${REF}?since=3d"
```

**▶ Recommended Next Actions:**
1. Check the publish status of a path that appears in the logs
   ```
   check status of {path}
   ```
2. Narrow results to an exact time window using a date range
   ```
   show logs from last hour
   ```

### View Logs with Time Range

```bash
curl -s \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/log/${ORG}/${SITE}/${REF}?from=2024-01-01T00:00:00Z&to=2024-01-02T00:00:00Z"
```

**▶ Recommended Next Actions:**
1. Check publish status of a path that appeared in the time range
   ```
   check status of {path}
   ```
2. Add a log entry to record a manual deployment action
   ```
   add log entry
   ```

### Add Log Entry

curl -s -X POST \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"entries": [{"message": "Manual deployment completed", "level": "info"}]}' \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/log/${ORG}/${SITE}/${REF}"
```

Log levels: `info`, `warn`, `error`
**▶ Recommended Next Actions:**
