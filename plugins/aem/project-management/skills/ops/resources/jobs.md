# Edge Delivery Services Operations - Job Management

Track and manage bulk operation jobs for Edge Delivery Services.

## When to Use

- A bulk preview or publish was triggered and you need to check its progress
- A job appears to be stuck or taking longer than expected
- Cancelling a bulk operation that was started by mistake
- Auditing recent bulk operations (preview/publish/index) and their outcomes
- Diagnosing why some pages were not included in a bulk operation result

## API Reference

| job status | `/job/{org}/{site}/{ref}/{topic}/{jobName}` | GET |
| job details | `/job/{org}/{site}/{ref}/{topic}/{jobName}/details` | GET |
| stop job | `/job/{org}/{site}/{ref}/{topic}/{jobName}` | DELETE |

## Job Topics

## Operations

### List Jobs

```bash
# List preview jobs
curl -s \
  -H "authorization: token ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/job/${ORG}/${SITE}/${REF}/preview"

# List publish jobs
curl -s \
  -H "authorization: token ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/job/${ORG}/${SITE}/${REF}/live"

# List index jobs
curl -s \
  -H "authorization: token ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/job/${ORG}/${SITE}/${REF}/index"
```

**On success:** Display results in a table with columns **Job Name**, **Topic**, **State**, **Processed**, **Total**, and **Started**. Report total count per topic.

**▶ Recommended Next Actions:**
1. Check progress of a specific job
   ```
   check job status {jobName}
   ```
2. See per-path results of a completed job
   ```
   get job details {jobName}
   ```
3. Cancel a stuck or unwanted job
   ```
   stop job {jobName}
   ```

### Get Job Status

```bash
curl -s \
  -H "authorization: token ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/job/${ORG}/${SITE}/${REF}/${TOPIC}/${JOB_NAME}"
```

**On success (200):** Display a status summary:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Job Name** | `{job.name}` |
| **State** | `{job.state}` (created / running / stopped) |
| **Processed** | `{job.progress.processed}` / `{job.progress.total}` |
| **Failed** | `{job.progress.failed}` |

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `state: created / running` | Job still in progress |
| `state: stopped` | Job completed or cancelled |
| `progress.processed` | Paths completed so far |
| `progress.total` | Total paths in job |

**▶ Recommended Next Actions:**
1. If job is still running, poll for updated progress
   ```
   check job status {jobName}
   ```
2. If job has stopped, review per-path results
   ```
   get job details {jobName}
   ```
3. If job is taking too long, cancel it
   ```
   stop job {jobName}
   ```

### Get Job Details

```bash
curl -s \
  -H "authorization: token ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/job/${ORG}/${SITE}/${REF}/${TOPIC}/${JOB_NAME}/details"
```

**On success (200):** Display results in a table with columns **Path**, **Status**, and **Error** (if any). Summarise: total paths, succeeded count, failed count. Highlight any failed paths.

**▶ Recommended Next Actions:**
1. If individual paths failed, retry them separately
   ```
   preview {failedPath}
   ```
2. If preview job completed successfully, promote to live
   ```
   publish all pages {folder}/
   ```
3. If publish job completed, clear CDN cache for the affected folder
   ```
   purge cache of {folder}/
   ```

### Stop Job

```bash
curl -s -X DELETE \
  -H "authorization: token ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/job/${ORG}/${SITE}/${REF}/${TOPIC}/${JOB_NAME}"
```

**Success:** `Stopped job {jobName}`

**▶ Recommended Next Actions:**
1. Review which paths completed before cancellation
   ```
   get job details {jobName}
   ```
2. Re-trigger for a single path to verify the operation
   ```
   preview {path}
   ```
3. Re-trigger with a reduced path scope
   ```
   preview all pages {folder}/
   ```

## Rate Limits

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Concurrent jobs | ~5 active jobs per org |
| Paths per bulk request | 1000 max |

Monitor job completion before starting new jobs to avoid hitting limits.

## Natural Language Patterns

| User Says | Operation |
|-----------|-----------|
| "show running jobs" | List jobs (all topics) |
| "list jobs" | List jobs (all topics) |
| "job status preview-123" | Get job status |
| "how is job preview-123 doing" | Get job status |
| "stop job preview-123" | Stop job |
| "cancel job index-456" | Stop job |
| "what jobs are running" | List jobs |
| "check bulk operation status" | List jobs |

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Job state reported clearly (running / completed / failed / stopped)
- ✅ Job details include processed count, error count, and any failed paths
- ✅ Stop operation confirmed with user before executing
- ✅ User directed to re-run the bulk operation for any failed paths after a job completes
