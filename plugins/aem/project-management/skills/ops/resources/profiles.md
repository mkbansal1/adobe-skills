# Edge Delivery Services Operations - Profile Configuration

Manage user profile-level configuration settings.

## When to Use

- Configuring site-specific CDN rules, response headers, or access controls for a named profile
- Reading the current profile settings before making changes
- Creating a new profile for a distinct audience or environment (e.g., `default`, `authenticated`)
- Updating header rules or metadata overrides that apply to a specific user segment
- Deleting an obsolete profile that is no longer in use

## API Reference

| Intent | Endpoint | Method |
|--------|----------|--------|
| read profile config | `/config/{org}/{site}/profiles/{profileId}.json` | GET |
| update profile config | `/config/{org}/{site}/profiles/{profileId}.json` | POST |
| create profile config | `/config/{org}/{site}/profiles/{profileId}.json` | PUT |

## Operations

### Read Profile Configuration

```bash
curl -s \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/config/${ORG}/${SITE}/profiles/${PROFILE_ID}.json"
```

**▶ Recommended Next Actions:**
1. Update profile settings if changes are required
   ```
   update profile config
   ```
2. Preview pages to verify the current profile configuration
   ```
   preview {path}
   ```

### Update Profile Configuration

**Requires Admin role.**

```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"property": "value"}' \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/config/${ORG}/${SITE}/profiles/${PROFILE_ID}.json"
```

**Success:** `Updated profile config: {profileId}`
**▶ Recommended Next Actions:**
1. Verify the update was applied correctly
   ```
   show profile config
   ```
2. Preview pages to confirm the profile changes render correctly
   ```
   preview {path}
   ```

### Create Profile Configuration

**Requires Admin role. Fails if profile already exists.**

```bash
curl -s -X PUT \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"property": "value"}' \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/config/${ORG}/${SITE}/profiles/${PROFILE_ID}.json"
```

**Success:** `Created profile config: {profileId}`
**▶ Recommended Next Actions:**
1. Verify the profile was created correctly
   ```
   show profile config
   ```
2. Update with additional settings as needed
   ```
   update profile config
   ```

### Delete Profile Configuration

**Requires Admin role.**

**DESTRUCTIVE OPERATION - CONFIRMATION REQUIRED**

Before executing, you MUST:
1. Tell user: "This will delete the profile configuration for '{profileId}'. Any settings specific to this profile will be lost."
2. Ask: "Do you want to proceed? (yes/no)"
3. Only execute if user confirms with "yes"

```bash
curl -s -X DELETE \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/config/${ORG}/${SITE}/profiles/${PROFILE_ID}.json"
```

**Success:** `Deleted profile config: {profileId}`
**▶ Recommended Next Actions:**
1. Verify the profile no longer exists
   ```
   show profile config
   ```
2. Create a replacement profile if needed
   ```
   create profile {profileId}
   ```
