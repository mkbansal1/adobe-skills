# Edge Delivery Services Operations - Secrets Management

Manage secrets for Edge Delivery Services at organization and site levels.

## When to Use

- Storing API keys, tokens, or credentials that edge workers or services need at runtime
- Rotating a secret that has been exposed or is due for renewal
- Auditing which secrets exist at org or site level before a security review
- Removing secrets for decommissioned integrations or services
- Setting up a new site integration that requires injecting credentials into the CDN layer

## Operations

### List Organization Secrets

**Requires Admin role.**

```bash
curl -s \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/config/${ORG}/secrets"
```

**▶ Recommended Next Actions:**
1. Create a new org-level secret for a shared integration
   ```
   create secret {name}
   ```
2. Delete a secret that is no longer in use
   ```
   delete secret {secretId}
   ```

### Create Organization Secret

**Requires Admin role.**

```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "MY_SECRET", "value": "secret-value"}' \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/config/${ORG}/secrets"
```

**Success:** `Created org secret: {name}`
**▶ Recommended Next Actions:**
1. List org secrets to confirm creation
   ```
   list org secrets
   ```
2. Create a site-level secret if the secret is site-specific
   ```
   create secret {name}
   ```

### Read Organization Secret

**Requires Admin role.**

```bash
curl -s \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/config/${ORG}/secrets/${SECRET_ID}"
```

**▶ Recommended Next Actions:**
1. Delete this secret if it is no longer needed
   ```
   delete secret {secretId}
   ```
2. List all org secrets to audit what is in use
   ```
   list org secrets
   ```

### Delete Organization Secret

**Requires Admin role.**

**DESTRUCTIVE OPERATION - CONFIRMATION REQUIRED**

Before executing, you MUST:
1. Tell user: "This will delete the secret '{secretId}' from the organization. Any integrations using this secret will break."
2. Ask: "Do you want to proceed? (yes/no)"
3. Only execute if user confirms with "yes"

```bash
curl -s -X DELETE \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/config/${ORG}/secrets/${SECRET_ID}"
```

**Success:** `Deleted org secret: {secretId}`
**▶ Recommended Next Actions:**
1. List org secrets to confirm removal
   ```
   list org secrets
   ```
2. If any integration broke, create a replacement secret
   ```
   create secret {name}
   ```

### List Site Secrets

**Requires Admin role.**

```bash
curl -s \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/config/${ORG}/${SITE}/secrets"
```

**▶ Recommended Next Actions:**
1. Create a new site-level secret for an integration
   ```
   create secret {name}
   ```
2. Delete a secret that is no longer in use
   ```
   delete secret {secretId}
   ```

### Create Site Secret

**Requires Admin role.**

```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "SITE_SECRET", "value": "secret-value"}' \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/config/${ORG}/${SITE}/secrets"
```

**Success:** `Created site secret: {name}`
**▶ Recommended Next Actions:**
1. List site secrets to confirm creation
   ```
   list secrets
   ```
2. Create an org-level secret if the secret applies to all sites
   ```
   list org secrets
   ```

### Read Site Secret

**Requires Admin role.**

```bash
curl -s \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/config/${ORG}/${SITE}/secrets/${SECRET_ID}"
```

**▶ Recommended Next Actions:**
1. Delete this secret if it is no longer needed
   ```
   delete secret {secretId}
   ```
2. List all site secrets to audit what is in use
   ```
   list secrets
   ```

### Delete Site Secret

**Requires Admin role.**

**DESTRUCTIVE OPERATION - CONFIRMATION REQUIRED**

Before executing, you MUST:
1. Tell user: "This will delete the secret '{secretId}' from site '{site}'. Any integrations using this secret will break."
2. Ask: "Do you want to proceed? (yes/no)"
3. Only execute if user confirms with "yes"

```bash
curl -s -X DELETE \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/config/${ORG}/${SITE}/secrets/${SECRET_ID}"
```

**Success:** `Deleted site secret: {secretId}`
**▶ Recommended Next Actions:**
1. List site secrets to confirm removal
   ```
   list secrets
   ```
2. If any integration broke, create a replacement secret
   ```
   create secret {name}
   ```

## Natural Language Patterns

| User Says | Operation |
|-----------|-----------|
| "list secrets" | List site secrets |
| "list org secrets" | List org secrets |
| "create secret MY_API_KEY" | Create secret (ask for value) |
| "add secret for site" | Create site secret |
| "delete secret X" | Delete secret |
| "show secrets" | List secrets |

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Secret list shows names and IDs (values are never returned by the API — this is expected)
- ✅ New secret confirmed with HTTP 200 and user warned that the value cannot be retrieved after creation
- ✅ Destructive operations (delete secret) confirmed with user before executing, with note on impacted services
- ✅ User reminded to update dependent services when a secret is rotated or deleted
