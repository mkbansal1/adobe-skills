# Edge Delivery Services Operations - Snapshots (Staged Releases)

Bundle multiple content changes for coordinated publishing.

## When to Use

- Coordinating a launch where multiple pages must go live at the same time
- Gating a content release behind a review and approval workflow before publishing
- Grouping related content changes (e.g., campaign, product launch) into a named bundle
- Rolling back a release by identifying and unpublishing the pages in a specific snapshot
- Staging content for a scheduled release while keeping the live site unchanged

## Operations

### List All Snapshots

```bash
curl -s \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/snapshot/${ORG}/${SITE}/main"
```

**▶ Recommended Next Actions:**
1. View the contents of a specific snapshot
   ```
   show snapshot {id}
   ```
2. Create a new snapshot for an upcoming release
   ```
   create snapshot {id}
   ```

### Create/Update Snapshot Manifest

```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "Q2 Launch", "description": "Product pages for Q2 release"}' \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/snapshot/${ORG}/${SITE}/main/${SNAPSHOT_ID}"
```

**Success:** `Snapshot "{id}" created`
**▶ Recommended Next Actions:**
1. Add pages to the snapshot
   ```
   add {path} to snapshot {id}
   ```
2. View the snapshot manifest to review contents
   ```
   show snapshot {id}
   ```

### Get Snapshot Manifest

```bash
curl -s \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/snapshot/${ORG}/${SITE}/main/${SNAPSHOT_ID}"
```

**▶ Recommended Next Actions:**
1. Add more pages to the snapshot
   ```
   add {path} to snapshot {id}
   ```
2. Publish the snapshot when all pages are ready
   ```
   publish snapshot {id}
   ```
3. Request a review before publishing
   ```
   lock snapshot {id} for review
   ```

### Add Resource to Snapshot

```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/snapshot/${ORG}/${SITE}/main/${SNAPSHOT_ID}${PATH}"
```

**Success:** `Added {path} to snapshot "{id}"`
**▶ Recommended Next Actions:**
1. View the manifest to confirm the addition
   ```
   show snapshot {id}
   ```
2. Add more pages to the snapshot
   ```
   add {path} to snapshot {id}
   ```
3. Publish the snapshot when all pages are ready
   ```
   publish snapshot {id}
   ```

### Bulk Add Resources

```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"paths": ["/products/new-widget", "/products/new-gadget", "/blog/announcement"]}' \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/snapshot/${ORG}/${SITE}/main/${SNAPSHOT_ID}/*"
```

**▶ Recommended Next Actions:**
1. Verify all paths were added correctly
   ```
   show snapshot {id}
   ```
2. Publish the snapshot when the content is ready
   ```
   publish snapshot {id}
   ```

### Remove Resource from Snapshot

```bash
curl -s -X DELETE \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/snapshot/${ORG}/${SITE}/main/${SNAPSHOT_ID}${PATH}"
```

**▶ Recommended Next Actions:**
1. Verify the resource was removed from the manifest
   ```
   show snapshot {id}
   ```
2. Add a replacement resource if needed
   ```
   add {path} to snapshot {id}
   ```

### Delete Entire Snapshot

**DESTRUCTIVE OPERATION - CONFIRMATION REQUIRED**

Before executing, you MUST:
1. Tell user: "This will permanently delete snapshot '{snapshotId}' and all its contents."
2. Ask: "Do you want to proceed? (yes/no)"
3. Only execute if user confirms with "yes"

```bash
curl -s -X DELETE \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/snapshot/${ORG}/${SITE}/main/${SNAPSHOT_ID}"
```

**▶ Recommended Next Actions:**
1. Confirm the snapshot no longer exists
   ```
   list snapshots
   ```
2. Create a new snapshot if the deletion was to start fresh
   ```
   create snapshot {id}
   ```

### Publish Single Resource

```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/snapshot/${ORG}/${SITE}/main/${SNAPSHOT_ID}${PATH}?publish=true"
```

**▶ Recommended Next Actions:**
1. Verify the page is live
   ```
   check status of {path}
   ```
2. Purge CDN cache if the page appears stale
   ```
   purge cache of {path}
   ```
3. Publish the remaining pages in the snapshot
   ```
   publish snapshot {id}
   ```

### Publish Entire Snapshot

**Requires Admin role.**

```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/snapshot/${ORG}/${SITE}/main/${SNAPSHOT_ID}?publish=true"
```

**Success:** `Published snapshot "{id}" - {count} pages now live`
**▶ Recommended Next Actions:**
1. Verify pages are live
   ```
   check status of {path}
   ```
2. Purge CDN cache if pages appear stale
   ```
   purge cache of {path}
   ```

### Request Review (Lock)

```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/snapshot/${ORG}/${SITE}/main/${SNAPSHOT_ID}?review=request"
```

**Success:** `Snapshot "{id}" locked for review`
**▶ Recommended Next Actions:**
1. Approve the snapshot once review is complete
   ```
   approve snapshot {id}
   ```
2. Reject if changes are required
   ```
   reject snapshot {id}
   ```

### Approve Snapshot

```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/snapshot/${ORG}/${SITE}/main/${SNAPSHOT_ID}?review=approve"
```

**Success:** `Snapshot "{id}" approved`
**▶ Recommended Next Actions:**
1. Publish the approved snapshot to live
   ```
   publish snapshot {id}
   ```
2. View the manifest one final time before publishing
   ```
   show snapshot {id}
   ```

### Reject Snapshot

```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "x-auth-token: ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  "https://admin.hlx.page/snapshot/${ORG}/${SITE}/main/${SNAPSHOT_ID}?review=reject"
```

**Success:** `Snapshot "{id}" rejected`
**▶ Recommended Next Actions:**
