## Communication Guidelines

- **NEVER use "EDS"** as an acronym for Edge Delivery Services in any responses
- Always use the full name "Edge Delivery Services" or "AEM Edge Delivery Services"
- Show clear, actionable error messages when operations fail
- Confirm destructive operations before executing
- **Recommended Next Actions format:** Always place each command in its own fenced code block so users get a one-click copy button. Use this structure:

  **▶ Recommended Next Actions:**
  1. Description of action
     ```
     command {path}
     ```
  2. Description of action
     ```
     command {path}
     ```

## Welcome Message

If user invokes the skill without a specific command (e.g., just `/ops` or "help me with ops"), show:

```
Edge Delivery Services Operations

Quick commands to try:
  list pages       - Show all indexed pages
  who am i         - Check your user profile
  list sites       - Show available sites
  show site config - View site configuration
  preview /path    - Preview a content path
  show logs        - View recent activity

Type 'help' for the full command list.
```

## Intent Router

Analyze user request and load the appropriate resource module.

### Step 0: Load Full Configuration

Read `resources/config.md`:
- **"Load Configuration"** section — loads `ORG`, `AUTH_TOKEN`, `IMS_TOKEN`, `SITE`, `REF`, `CODE_OWNER`, `CODE_REPO` from saved config
- **"Parse from AEM URL"** section — if the user's request contains an `*.aem.page` or `*.aem.live` URL, parse `REF`, `SITE`, `ORG`, `PATH` from it (overrides saved config values)
- **"Setup If Missing"** section — if any required value is still empty after loading

**After loading, check prerequisites:**

**If `ORG` is empty**, you MUST pause and ask the user:

> "What is your Config Service organization name? This is the `{org}` part of your Edge Delivery Services URLs (e.g., `https://main--site--{org}.aem.page`).
>
> **Note:** The org name may differ from your GitHub organization, especially in repoless multi-site setups."

**STRICTLY FORBIDDEN - Do NOT attempt any of these to get org name:**
- `git remote -v` - GitHub org often differs from Config Service org
- Reading `fstab.yaml` - Does not contain org name
- Inferring from folder/repo names - Unreliable
- Any other inference method

**ONLY use the org name from:**
- Saved config (`.claude-plugin/project-config.json`)
- Direct user input when prompted

**Do NOT proceed until org is confirmed.**

**If `AUTH_TOKEN` is empty or missing**, you MUST invoke the auth skill BEFORE proceeding:

```
Skill({ skill: "project-management:auth" })
```

This opens a browser via Playwright for Adobe ID login and saves the token to `.claude-plugin/project-config.json`.

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT skip this step. Do NOT attempt any API calls without a valid auth token. The auth skill handles the entire authentication flow.

**If `IMS_TOKEN` is empty** and the operation requires it (preview, publish, unpublish, cache, code):
> "I need an Adobe IMS Bearer token to perform this operation. Please open DevTools on any DA or AEM page → Network tab → copy the `authorization: Bearer eyJ...` value from any request and share it here."

**Two tokens, two purposes:**

| Token | Header | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `AUTH_TOKEN` (admin JWT) | `authorization: token ${AUTH_TOKEN}` | Status checks, job queries, index reads |
| `IMS_TOKEN` (IMS Bearer) | `authorization: Bearer ${IMS_TOKEN}` + `x-content-source-authorization: Bearer ${IMS_TOKEN}` | Preview, publish, unpublish, cache, code sync |

### Step 1: Route by Intent

| User Intent | Resource Module |
|-------------|-----------------|
| preview, publish, unpublish, status, delete preview | `resources/content.md` |
| bulk status, status of all pages, get status of all pages | `resources/content.md` |
| cache, purge, clear cache, invalidate, bust cache | `resources/cache.md` |
| force purge, force clear, purge full cache | `resources/cache.md` |
| sync code, deploy code, update code | `resources/code.md` |
| reindex, index, remove from index, search | `resources/index.md` |
| index status, show index status | `resources/index.md` |
| sitemap, generate sitemap | `resources/sitemap.md` |
| snapshot, staged release, bundle | `resources/snapshots.md` |
| logs, audit, activity | `resources/logs.md` |
| user, access, permission, who am i, add user, remove user | `resources/users.md` |
| job, bulk operation, stop job, list jobs | `resources/jobs.md` |
| job details, get job details | `resources/jobs.md` |
| site, branch, switch, list sites | `resources/sites.md` |
| org config, site config, robots.txt | `resources/config-api.md` |
| secret, secrets, create secret, delete secret | `resources/secrets.md` |
| API key, apikey, create key, revoke key | `resources/apikeys.md` |
| token, tokens, access token | `resources/tokens.md` |
| profile config, profile settings | `resources/profiles.md` |
| index config, helix-index, search config | `resources/index-config.md` |
| sitemap config, helix-sitemap, sitemap rules | `resources/sitemap-config.md` |
| version, versions, history, rollback, restore | `resources/versioning.md` |
| pages, list pages, indexed pages, all pages | `resources/pages.md` |

### Step 4: Read Resource and Execute

1. Read the appropriate resource file from `resources/`
2. Follow instructions in that resource
3. Execute the API call
4. Handle the response using the table below — then return formatted result

**Response Handler:**

| HTTP | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| **200** | Success | Format and display result |
| **204** | Success (no content) | Confirm completion — e.g. "Unpublished `/path` from live" |
| **202** | Accepted (async job) | Show job name + `"To track: use ops skill to check job status {jobName}"` |
| **400** | Bad request | Show raw API error message — it usually contains a specific fix hint |
| **401** | Token expired | "Your session has expired. Provide a fresh IMS Bearer token: open DevTools → Network tab → copy `authorization: Bearer eyJ...` from any request." |
| **403** | Insufficient permissions | "You don't have permission for this operation. This requires {Admin/Author} role on `{site}`." |
| **404** (path) | Content not found | "Path `{path}` was not found. Verify it exists in your content source (SharePoint/DA)." |
| **404** (org/site) | Not onboarded | "Org `{org}` or site `{site}` not found. It may not be onboarded to Admin Service." |
| **422** | Validation failed | "Content failed validation: {error details from API response}" |
| **429** | Rate limited | "Too many requests. Wait 30–60 seconds then retry." |
| **500** | Server error | "Admin Service encountered an error. This is temporary — wait and retry. If persistent, check status.adobe.com." |
| **502/503** | Unavailable | "Admin Service temporarily unavailable. Wait a few minutes and retry." |

**Always include the raw API error message** when available — it often contains the specific fix (e.g. `wildcard paths are not supported with a markup mountpoint`).

## Security & Confirmation Requirements

**CRITICAL: Always confirm before executing destructive operations.**

### Destructive Operations (Require User Confirmation)

| Operation | Resource | Risk Level |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Unpublish (single/bulk) | `content.md` | HIGH - Removes from live site |
| Delete preview | `content.md` | MEDIUM |
| Delete code | `code.md` | HIGH - Affects all sites in repoless |
| Remove from index | `index.md` | MEDIUM - Removes from search |
| Delete snapshot | `snapshots.md` | MEDIUM |
| Remove user | `users.md` | HIGH - Revokes access |
| Stop job | `jobs.md` | LOW |
| Delete org/site config | `config-api.md` | CRITICAL - Can break site |
| Delete secret | `secrets.md` | HIGH - Can break integrations |
| Revoke API key | `apikeys.md` | HIGH - Can break CI/CD |

### Confirmation Protocol

Before ANY destructive operation:

1. **State the action clearly**: "This will unpublish /products/old-widget from the live site"
2. **Explain the impact**: "Users will get a 404 error when visiting this URL"
3. **Ask for explicit confirmation**: "Do you want to proceed? (yes/no)"
4. **Only execute after user confirms with "yes"**

### Token Security

- Auth tokens are stored in `.claude-plugin/project-config.json`
- This directory MUST be in `.gitignore`
- Tokens expire after ~24 hours
- Never log or display full token values

## Prerequisites

This skill works with AEM Edge Delivery Services projects that are:

1. **Onboarded to Admin Service** - Project must have admin.hlx.page access
2. **User has Adobe IMS account** - Required for authentication
3. **User has appropriate role** - Admin or Author on the site
4. **Network access** - Can reach admin.hlx.page (not blocked by firewall)
