# Dispatcher Config Authoring (Cloud)

Design minimal, deterministic Dispatcher/HTTPD changes for AEMaaCS and verify with MCP evidence.

## Variant Scope

- This skill is cloud-only.
- Scope is fixed by this plugin path; do not ask the user to choose deployment variant.

## MCP Tool Contract

Use only these Dispatcher MCP tools:

- `validate`
- `lint`
- `sdk`
- `trace_request`
- `inspect_cache`
- `monitor_metrics`
- `tail_logs`

## Workflow

```text
Cloud Config Progress
- [ ] 1) Confirm scope and acceptance criteria
- [ ] 2) Apply cloud guardrails (immutable files, required includes, CDN-vs-Dispatcher boundary)
- [ ] 3) Decompose target URLs (path/selectors/extension/suffix) and use that model for all URL-based rules—filters, cache rules, etc.—using `/path`, `/selectors`, `/extension`, `/suffix` or aligned globs (not raw `/url`) where applicable; then design complete section-level edits
- [ ] 4) Update config with least-privilege defaults (produce final merged section, not isolated rule snippets)
- [ ] 5) Run static checks: validate -> lint (deep/order-aware when filters changed)
- [ ] 6) Run SDK checks: `sdk({"action":"check-files","config_path":"<dispatcher src path>"})`, `sdk({"action":"diff-baseline","config_path":"<dispatcher src path>"})` as needed
- [ ] 7) Run runtime verification in container-backed environment
- [ ] 8) Return diff, evidence table, risk/rollback, and citations
```

## Verification Scope Selection

Use the shared references to select the minimum evidence set:

- [mode-specific-verification-matrix.md](./references/technical-advisory/mode-specific-verification-matrix.md)
- [test-case-catalog.md](./references/technical-advisory/test-case-catalog.md)

## Output Contract

Always include:

- files changed + intent
- exact insertion location and final merged section content for each edited block
- checks executed + evidence
- selected test IDs
- risk/rollback plan
- residual risks and next checks

## Guardrails

- Do not weaken deny-by-default security posture without explicit user approval.
- Do not claim runtime verification if container/runtime prerequisites were missing.
- Keep changes minimal and scoped.
- Enforce cloud guardrails from `cloud-aemaacs-guardrails.md` before proposing config edits.
