# Dispatcher Technical Advisory (Cloud)

Provide deterministic guidance for AEMaaCS dispatcher use cases.

## Variant Scope

- This skill is cloud-only.
- Scope is fixed by this plugin path; do not ask the user to choose deployment variant.

## MCP Tool Contract

Use only these Dispatcher MCP tools when producing verification plans:

- `validate`
- `lint`
- `sdk`
- `trace_request`
- `inspect_cache`
- `monitor_metrics`
- `tail_logs`

## Workflow

1. Confirm scope and assumptions.
2. Apply [cloud-aemaacs-guardrails.md](./references/technical-advisory/cloud-aemaacs-guardrails.md) to lock immutable/include constraints and CDN-vs-Dispatcher boundaries.
3. Use [capability-coverage-map.md](./references/technical-advisory/capability-coverage-map.md) to route prompt/tool/resource intents to the right dispatcher skill flow.
4. Select a scenario path from [core7-capability-playbook.md](./references/technical-advisory/core7-capability-playbook.md) for development/debugging requests.
5. For conceptual questions (e.g. statfileslevel, filter order, URL decomposition, cache invalidation), use [concepts.md](./references/technical-advisory/concepts.md) and cite official docs.
6. Use curated public references for recommendations in this variant.
7. Produce MCP verification steps for this variant when needed.
8. Route execution-heavy changes to this variant's execution skills.

## Verification Scope Selection

Use shared references for deterministic coverage:

- [mode-specific-verification-matrix.md](./references/technical-advisory/mode-specific-verification-matrix.md)
- [test-case-catalog.md](./references/technical-advisory/test-case-catalog.md)

## Output Contract

Use one of these output shapes:

- Explanation-only question: recommendation summary + citation list from curated public-docs index.
- Recommendation/change question: recommendation summary + citation list + MCP verification plan with expected evidence + risk/rollback guidance and open risks.

## Guardrails

- Do not claim a check was executed unless tool evidence exists.
- Keep variant assumptions explicit for every recommendation.
- For migration/cross-variant requests, produce a side-by-side variant delta plan from the verification matrix and flag when the companion variant plugin must be run separately.
- Follow citation discipline from `public-doc-citation-rules.md`.
- Keep cloud-only guardrails explicit: immutable/default include contracts and CDN-vs-Dispatcher ownership.
