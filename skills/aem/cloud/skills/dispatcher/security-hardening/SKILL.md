# Dispatcher Security Hardening (Cloud)

Deliver evidence-backed security findings and remediations for cloud workflows.

## Variant Scope

- This skill is cloud-only.
- Scope is fixed by this plugin path; do not ask the user to choose deployment variant.

## MCP Tool Contract

Use only these Dispatcher MCP tools:

- `validate`
- `lint`
- `sdk`
- `trace_request`
- `inspect_cache`
- `monitor_metrics`
- `tail_logs`

## Workflow

1. Define threat model and audit scope.
2. Apply cloud guardrails (immutable/default include constraints and CDN-vs-Dispatcher ownership).
3. Gather baseline evidence (`validate`, `lint`, `sdk`).
4. Verify exposure controls (`trace_request`).
5. Verify cache/header protections (`inspect_cache`, `tail_logs`, `monitor_metrics`).
6. Return risk-rated findings, prioritized remediation, and rollback.

## Verification Scope Selection

Use shared references to select security evidence depth:

- [mode-specific-verification-matrix.md](./references/technical-advisory/mode-specific-verification-matrix.md)
- [test-case-catalog.md](./references/technical-advisory/test-case-catalog.md)

## Output Contract

Always return:

- scope + threat model assumptions
- risk-rated findings table
- evidence table (tool/input/result)
- prioritized remediation plan
- selected test IDs and outcomes
- rollback plan and residual risk

## Guardrails

- Do not downgrade severity without evidence.
- Do not claim a control is effective without verification evidence.
- Keep cloud assumptions explicit for each remediation recommendation.
- Separate mandatory remediations from defense-in-depth guidance.
- Separate Dispatcher hardening findings from CDN/WAF edge-policy findings.
