# Dispatcher Technical Advisory (AMS)

Provide deterministic guidance for AEM 6.5/AMS dispatcher use cases.

## Variant Scope

- This skill is AMS-only.
- Scope is fixed by this plugin path; do not ask the user to choose deployment variant.

## MCP Tool Contract

Use only these Dispatcher MCP tools when producing verification plans:

- `validate`
- `lint`
- `sdk`
- `trace_request`
- `inspect_cache`
- `monitor_metrics`
- `tail_logs`

## Workflow

1. Confirm scope and assumptions.
2. Use [capability-coverage-map.md](./references/technical-advisory/capability-coverage-map.md) to route prompt/tool/resource intents to the right dispatcher skill flow.
3. Select a scenario path from [core7-capability-playbook.md](./references/technical-advisory/core7-capability-playbook.md) for development/debugging requests.
4. For conceptual questions (e.g. statfileslevel, filter order, URL decomposition, cache invalidation), use [concepts.md](./references/technical-advisory/concepts.md) and cite official docs.
5. Apply [ams-6-5-guardrails.md](./references/technical-advisory/ams-6-5-guardrails.md) before recommendations (tier boundaries, variables, flush ACL, immutable constraints).
6. Use curated public references for recommendations in this variant.
7. Produce MCP verification steps for this variant when needed.
8. Route execution-heavy changes to this variant's execution skills.

## Verification Scope Selection

Use shared references for deterministic coverage:

- [mode-specific-verification-matrix.md](./references/technical-advisory/mode-specific-verification-matrix.md)
- [test-case-catalog.md](./references/technical-advisory/test-case-catalog.md)

## Output Contract

Use one of these output shapes:

- Explanation-only question: recommendation summary + citation list from curated public-docs index.
- Recommendation/change question: recommendation summary + citation list + MCP verification plan with expected evidence + risk/rollback guidance and open risks.

## Guardrails

- Do not claim a check was executed unless tool evidence exists.
- Keep variant assumptions explicit for every recommendation.
- For migration/cross-variant requests, produce a side-by-side variant delta plan from the verification matrix and flag when the companion variant plugin must be run separately.
- Follow citation discipline from `public-doc-citation-rules.md`.
